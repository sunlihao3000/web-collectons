## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.10 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)



Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8001
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `gulp`.
