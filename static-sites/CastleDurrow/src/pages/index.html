                        <p>One of Ireland’s most luxurious Country House Hotels located on the N8 old Dublin –
                        Cork Road (one hour from Dublin), in the midlands of Ireland,
                        adjoining the quaint village of Durrow,Co Laois.
                        Built by Capt.
